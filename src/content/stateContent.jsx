      academicOverview: `
By adopting the NGSS outright, Hawaii ensures climate education is woven into its science curriculum, even though the NGSS addresses climate change with only moderate rigor. Hawaii’s social studies standards also include climate change, where it is both listed as an example under certain standards and as a standard in itself in MS World History and Culture (see below). Other elective social studies courses also include climate change as standards.

**Relevant Standards:**

 - <u>[Science (2013):](https://hawaiipublicschools.org/academics/subject-matter-standards/)</u> They use the NGSS, so yes in MS and HS. Refer to the NGSS page to see what standards include climate change.
 - <u>[Social Studies:](https://hawaiipublicschools.org/academics/subject-matter-standards/)</u>
     - Climate change is listed as an example under grade 3 standard SS.3.4.14.2, MS standard SS.US.12.16.12, and MS standard SS.7PI.3.17.2
     - Climate change is a standard: “Analyze the factors affecting climate change and global sustainability”, taught in MS World History and Culture.
     - Also taught in HS elective courses - American Problems (implied under environmental topics), Filipino history and culture (directly a standard), Global Studies (implied under environmental topics)

      currentLegislation: `
Hawaii saw a number of climate education bills/resolutions introduced in the 2025 session, which adjourned on May 2, 2025. **None of them passed and were signed into law:**

- [HB 1491](https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HB1491/2025) would have required the Department of Education to “develop and implement a statewide curriculum plan… that integrates climate education and sustainability”. **The bill died in committee.**
- [HB 99](https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HB99/2025) would have required the Department of Education to establish a climate literacy certificate program. **The bill died in committee.**
- [HR 81/HCR 87](https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HCR87/2025) would have encouraged the Department of Education to establish an annual climate week for all public schools. **The resolution passed the House, but died before the Senate took any action.**
     - House Resolutions (HR) and House Concurrent Resolutions (HCR) are legally non-binding and simply express the intent of legislative chambers. The same applies for Senate Resolutions. In order for something to become law, it must be introduced and passed as a bill. Resolutions often have language such as “urges, encourages, requests…” rather than “mandates, requires…”. Regardless, resolutions are still a good way to advance climate education.

Prior to the 2025 session, Hawaii has seen other climate education bills/resolutions:

- [HR 134/HCR 134](https://open.pluralpolicy.com/hi/bills/2022%20Regular%20Session/HR134/) was a resolution in the 2022 legislative session that would request the DOE “to ensure that career and technical education standards focus on place-based responsiveness to climate change and preparing students to engage in a growing green economy.” **HR 134/HCR 134 was adopted in the house but eventually died in the Senate Committee.**
- [SCR 58](https://legiscan.com/HI/text/SCR58/2020) was a resolution introduced in the 2020 legislative session that would have “urged the board of education to mandate climate change curriculum in all public schools”. **The bill did not gain traction in the senate (house of origin), and ultimately died in committee.**
